# 💧 BreatheWell: Hydrate & Heal

A beautiful, interactive frontend project that blends **wellness with visual storytelling**. BreatheWell empowers users to **track their daily water intake** through a human-body visualizer and unwind with an **emotion-responsive breathing animation** — a micro-experience in mindful self-care.

## 🌟 Features

### 🧍‍♂️ Water Intake Tracker

### 🌬️ Breathing Animation Visualizer

- **Visual breathing guide:** See pulsing animations, flower blooms, or abstract waves synced to inhale/hold/exhale cycles.
- **Adaptive pace:** Breathing speed adjusts based on emotion.

## 🎯 Purpose

In a world full of chaotic dashboards and rigid wellness trackers, **BreatheWell** invites users to slow down and take care of themselves — visually, emotionally, and interactively.

We set out to solve two micro-problems:
1. **Tracking hydration** should feel intuitive, not clinical.
2. **Breathing exercises** should be immersive, not generic.

## 🧠 Inspiration

This project was built for a frontend hackathon where **user experience**, **visual design**, and **functionality** were key. By combining two seemingly simple ideas — drinking water and breathing — we created a holistic micro-wellness tool.
